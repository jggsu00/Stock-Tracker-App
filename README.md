The Stock Tracker App is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to monitor stock prices, read market news, view simple charts, and maintain a categorized watchlist. Built with Firebase for authentication and Firestore for real-time data storage, this app fetches real-time market data using the Finnhub API. Users can search for stock symbols, view current pricing and trends, and save favorite stocks into a personalized watchlist grouped by sector.
